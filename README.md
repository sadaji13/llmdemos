### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

The site does NOT work as is. The "select a county" button is at least clickable, but it doesn't actually show any options when you click on it. The statewide totals seem to be eternally loading.
The second try is much better - it's actually responsive! Maybe because this time I told it to be.
